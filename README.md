The goal is to use this repo to learn more about DevOps.

Successful implementation so far:
  CI! A python linter from Github Actions is added. See the .yaml file in the project.

Separate of this project, I've downloaded Terraform and Docker. I've done their 'Hello World' equivalent after installing VS Code. I'm considering the cloud provider next, and then will look to see if I can deploy using Git and Github Actions.

Outside of consumiing a ton of content on DevOps, SRE, and CI/CD, I will use this project for hands-on experience.  
No idea how I will approach that.. For now, I know I want to use Python.  
  For this project, I am listing out some ideas for the tech stack..  
  A) Cloud provider to host the app (won't deal with this for awhile).. Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Provider (GCP)  
    Alt. cloud provider.. Firebase, Heroku. Great for minimal viable product (MVP) demonstration.  
    Whatever is chosen, need to understand how their service performs virtualization and networking.  
  B) Linux.. Be comfy with searching, installing, configuring packages  
  C) Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).. MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite? If I have a DBA, this won't be as important.  
  D) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. Terraform is very popular, but may need to use a forked version of it since it will cost money soon(??).  
  E) Domain Naming System (DNS). The issue will always be DNS. ðŸ˜‰  
  F) CI/CD tool. Jenkins, Github Actions... layerci?  
  G) Documentation tool. Veeva Qdocs, Confluence, Notepad ðŸ˜ˆ  

techs to consider for stack  
Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Kubernetes, jenkins.
